ldesc: "rsync is a file transfer program. rsync uses the 'rsync algorithm'
which provides a very fast method for bringing
remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the
differences in the files across the link, without requiring
that both sets of files are present at one of the ends of the
link beforehand."
