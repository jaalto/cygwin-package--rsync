These are the main patches to the rsync source.
(The changes to the manpages for correct hyphens
and quotes is a bit big, so not included.)

If you're wondering about the lack of patches, the
explanation is that upstream has adopted most of them :-)

logdir.diff             - fix the location of the logdir
ssh-6-option.diff       - call ssh with -6 option if rsync was called with -6,
                          ditto with -4
CVE-2014-2855_infinite_loop_unknown_username.diff
			- It was found that when rsync is configured to
			  authenticate users, a remote attacker could send a
			  request using an invalid username that, when
			  processed by rsync, would cause the rsync daemon to
			  enter an infinite loop. Multiple requests to a single
			  server using rsync with authentication of users could
			  result in a denial of service through CPU exhaustion.
